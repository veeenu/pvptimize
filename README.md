# PvPtimize

Pokémon GO PvP simulation/optimization engine.
Incomplete use cases wishlist:
- Find a new, empirical ranking measure by actually simulating all possible mirror matches according to IV (i.e. best IV is the IV that wins the most)
- Check correlation between said measure and the stat product
- Constrained team optimization -- i.e. best 6 Pokémon combination in a given Silph league according to type coverage/number of wins/what have you, best 3 Pokémon out of my team against a team of 6 other Pokémon and so on
